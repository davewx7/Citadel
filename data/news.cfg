<font size='+50%'>Quests!</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Nov 23, 2017</i></font>

We have added <i>quests</i> to Argentum Age. Every day you will be assigned a quest, and will receive a gold reward upon completing it. We hope that quests will encourage you to try playing Argentum Age in a variety of ways and keep players engaged in the game.

<font size='+50%'>New Creature Design</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Oct 29, 2017</i></font>

We have been working hard over the last few weeks smoothing out bugs and making the Argentum Age experience as polished as possible. Included in this is a new design for the look of creatures. Rather than text describing what their abilities do, we have a much cleaner new design which uses icons instead.

This new design shows off the artwork, while allowing you to still mouse-over the creature to get a full description of their abilities. Enjoy!

<font size='+50%'>Let's Play Some Multiplayer</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Oct 14, 2017</i></font>
<img src='images/portraits/card-size/staged-duel.png' width='116'/>

We have streamlined the multiplayer lobby to make it easier to select your deck and get into a game. Pressing the 'Play' button will queue into a match and if you aren't already playing a multiplayer match you will get notified whenever someone queues for multiplayer so you have the opportunity to challenge them.

We have also upped the rewards for participating in multiplayer. You now earn 50 gold just for playing, and 200 gold if you win! So while the campaign is fun, try playing some multiplayer!

<font size='+50%'>New Cards, Rule Changes</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Oct 5, 2017</i></font>
- We have added three <i>'Radial Lands'</i> to the core set. How do they work? Rather than affecting creatures in the lane, they affect your <i>Nearby</i> creatures. A creature is nearby if it's on the tile the land is on or on one of the neighboring tiles. Radial Lands intend to encourage risk-taking: the most strategic positions for these lands are ones where they are most likely to be captured. Without further ado, we present the <font tag='obj:card:Glade of Fury'>Glade of Fury</font>, the <font tag='obj:card:Dark Spire'>Dark Spire</font>, and the <font tag='obj:card:Temple of Triumph'>Temple of Triumph</font>.
- Some additional spell cards have been added, including <font tag='obj:card:Terramorph'>Terramorph</font>, <font tag='obj:card:Ambush'>Ambush</font>, and <font tag='obj:card:Last Stand'>Last Stand</font>.
- Rule changes/fixes: Valiant creatures now die at the end of the turn rather at the start of the next turn. This means that cards such as Hypothermia can kill Valiant creatures. Furious Rampage now kills Cave Troll like it does any other creature.
- We are trialing removing the rule that made it so that spells and abilities cannot finish players off. Now, Fireballs, Blood Altars, and even your own Skeletal Parasites can kill you. We found that it was making some matchups just take too long, becoming stalemates without effects like this working.
- Some removal spells have been mildly nerfed, such as Polymorph. Also, Oil of Anointing received a small nerf.

"<font size='+50%'>Patch Notes</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Oct 1, 2017</i></font>
- Fixed a campaign bug in Irendahl fields which prevented progressing beyond 75% completion.
- Changed rules regarding where a land can be conjured, to prevent conjuring a land on a tile where an enemy creature is.
- Added animation when you take damage from the shadow deck
- Made it so creature abilities that do damage to players without killing them don't reduce life below 1. Previously the life would drop below 1 momentarily before being restored, which was confusing.
- Fixed some bugs in the library/shop allowing you to purchase cards even when you had insufficient funds.
- Made it so clicking a creature with movement and activated abilities will access the creature's activated abilities. Clicking that creature a second time will cause it to move.

<font size='+50%'>Introducing the <i>Soul Thief</i></font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Sep 20, 2017</i></font>
<font tag='obj:card:Soul Thief'><img src='images/portraits/card-size/vampire.png' width='116'/></font>

Replacing the <i>Vampire</i> card, the <i>Soul Thief</i> steals both the attack and life of its victims adding them to its own totals when killing an enemy creature. How large can your Soul Thief grow?

<font size='+50%'>Some Small Tweaks</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Sep 7, 2017</i></font>
A variety of cards have been tweaked lately, including making the 'hero' cards a little less powerful.

You can now move individual creatures by clicking on them if you want to choose the order in which creatures move. Buying now works in both possible views in the library.

<font size='+50%'>A Sapling Grows</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>May 13, 2017</i>
</font>
We have reworked the <font tag='obj:card:Treant Sapling'>Treant Sapling</font>. It starts out as a piddling little 3/3 for 3, but each turn that you keep it in your hand it grows a little larger. How long will you keep it in your hand before deciding it's time to unleash it on the battlefield?

"<font size='+50%'>New Settings UI</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>May 8, 2016</i></font>

Settings screens might not be the most exciting part of a game, but providing a clean, consistent, usable UI is important for the best possible user experience.

Our new settings UI design is intended to be streamlined, attractive and easy to use.

"<font size='+50%'>Random opponents, new logo</font>

Sometimes life is a little bit better when a few things are left to chance. You can now choose to match against a random rival when playing against the AI.

We have also prettied things up with some new icons to match!
